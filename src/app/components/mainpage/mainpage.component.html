I also joined the class to get to learn new and other programing languages that are used for Software Development both Front-End & Back-End developments. I decided to join a class to get to fine tune my skills and learn the basic and get a better understanding of what programming is and how to go about the different problems or obstacles that I may come accross while in the field of programming. I decided to join the class to get to network and meet more people who are in the field and learn something from them and also share my knowledge.
